This is my assignment of Data Preprocessing on Data Science Class. 
The assignment is about determining the linear regression of 2 features on the scraped data. The dataset itself was taken from  https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all/2501. 
On this assignment, columns that are used : Production Budget and Worldwide Gross. 

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

Another advantages of Linear Regression :
1. Evaluating Trends and Sales Estimates
2. Analyzing the Impact of Price Changes
3. Assessing Risk

For example
A movie producer might conduct a linear regression plotting number of production budget per previous film against worldwide gross and discover that older budget tend to make different worldwide revenue. The results of such an analysis might guide important business decisions made to account for risk.
